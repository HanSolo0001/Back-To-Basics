        <h1>My Practice, Hopes, Fears, And Everything Else</h1>
        <p class="firstParagraph">
            This is my test and practice of basic languages. I <strong>can</strong> do this. I may <i>doubt</i> myself and my abilities. I have fear of not being good enough or fast enough. Why would developers want to hire me than someone else? I do have <span class="passion">passion</span> for this though. Coding is fun. I don't know if I want to build websites, mobile development, or both. I just enjoy playing and writing code. It's fun. I want to understand what I'm doing and think like a developer. I want to debug the crap out of things, and unit test everything. I want to learn. I want to do my best. I want this to be my life. This would give me the opportunity to better provide for my family while doing something I love.
